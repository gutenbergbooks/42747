<h2><a name="NOTE" id="NOTE">NOTE.</a></h2>

<p>The following pages are the substance of a course of lectures on the old
Shinto cult which the author has been giving for a number of years to
his classes in Comparative Religion. They are here condensed and adapted
to the purpose of a little manual which, it is believed, may interest
many readers, and bring together within a small space information
gathered from many sources not easily accessible to ordinary students.
At the same time it is hoped that this little volume may serve to
suggest some valuable hints to the Christian missionary who is to come
face to face with the Japanese people in their "beautiful land of the
reed plains and the fresh ears of rice." It is possible that some
portions, if not every jot and tittle, of this ancient cult may, like
the law and the prophets of Israel, find a glorious fulfillment in the
pure gospel of Jesus Christ. The principal authorities relied on in the
preparation of this essay are named in the Select Bibliography given at
the end.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SHINTO_CULT" id="THE_SHINTO_CULT">THE SHINTO CULT.</a></h2>

<p><b><a name="Section_1" id="Section_1">1. The Country.</a></b> In taking up the study of a religion which has never
extended beyond the limits of an easily defined territory, we may
appropriately first of all take a hasty glance at the geographical
outlines of the system we call Shinto, the primitive faith of the people
of Japan. To appreciate the geographical position of Japan, one needs to
have before him a map of the world. He may then see at a glance how
remarkably the three thousand islands of that Empire stretch for some
twenty-five hundred miles along the coast of Asia, from Kamchatka on the
north to the island of Formosa on the south, which island is crossed by
the tropic of Cancer. It may be called the longest and the narrowest
country in the world. It looks like an immense sea-serpent, with its
northern tail twist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>ing toward the Aleutian Islands, which our
Government acquired from Russia in 1867, and its southern head pointing
toward the Philippine Islands, which we acquired from Spain in recent
years. It seems to guard the whole eastern coast of Asia, and along with
China, on the mainland, is suspected and feared by some European
diplomats as embodying some sort of a "Yellow Peril." It may be that its
noteworthy contiguity to our Alaskan possessions at one extremity and
our Philippine wards at the other bodes some sort of peril to any
Western nation that may hereafter presume to enlarge its dominions in
the Orient by force of arms.</p>

<p>Attention has often been called to the fact that the British Isles, in
the Atlantic Ocean, just off the northwestern coast of Europe, occupy a
corresponding geographical relation to the Western world. The islands
themselves are comparatively small, but their measuring line has gone
out into all the earth, and their civilization is dominating the world.
Asia, on the east of the Eastern hemisphere, is a land of innumerable
population; Europe, on the west, is a land of new ideas and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> of hopeful
progress. The United States, resting her Atlantean shoulder on the
island-empire of Europe, and her Pacific shoulder on the island-empire
of the Orient, may be, in the order of God, a mighty mediator, possessed
both of a great population and of new and commanding ideas, and destined
to bring about the universal peace, the sound knowledge, and the highest
prosperity of the world.</p>

<p>We are told that Japan is a country of diversified beauty. Compassed
round about with the vast ocean, yet not far from the Asiatic mainland;
supplied also with a wonderful inland sea, and with lakes and rivers and
fountains of waters; a land of mountains, and valleys, and broad
meadows, and all manner of trees and shrubs and fruits and flowers, and
charming landscapes, and all varieties of climate; it is no wonder that
the people and their poets have called this group of islands "the sun's
nest," "the country of the sun-goddess," "the region between heaven and
earth," "islands of the congealed drop," "the grand land of the eight
isles," "central land of reed-plains," "land of the ears of fresh rice,"
"land of a thousand autumns,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> and other similar names indicative of
manifold excellence.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>This island-empire of the Orient is the home of the religious cult
called "Shinto," a religion which has never traveled nor sought to
propagate itself beyond the dominions of Japan. It has never put itself
in a hostile attitude toward any other form of religion, either at home
or abroad, except when a foreign cult has entered its ancient home and
sought to meddle with affairs of State or to interfere with loyalty to
the Emperor.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_2" id="Section_2">2. Is Shinto a Religion?</a></b> At a meeting of the Society of Science, held at
Tokyo in 1890, the president of the Imperial University expressed the
opinion that Shinto should not be regarded as a religion. He believed it
to be an essential element in the existing national thought and feeling
of Japan, but destitute of the essential qualities of a strictly
religious cult. Others have expressed a similar opinion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> but we are
disposed to think that this judgment arises from an incorrect concept of
religion, and a consequent defective definition of the same. A similar
denial has been made of the religious character of other cults and
systems. Taoism, Confucianism, and even Buddhism have been said to lack
the elements essential to a real religion. But if these systems do not
constitute a religion for the peoples who accept them, they are in every
case their substitute for religion. Any religion or any form of religion
may so involve its thought and its practices with philosophical
speculation, or with social customs, or with the political management of
the State, as to have the appearance of a philosophical or a political
system, rather than a form of religion. But, however it may, in such
ways, ignore the religious ideas and practices of other systems, if
there be no other religious cult among the people, the philosophy, the
ethical policy and the customs, which make up this important element of
the civilization and the national life, are as truly tantamount to a
religious cult as any form of faith and practice which all men agree to
call religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a name="Section_3" id="Section_3">3. Origin and Relative Age of the People.</a></b> The main body of the Japanese
people are believed to have migrated in old times from the northern
central part of Asia, and to have worked their way eastward into Korea,
and thence into the islands of Japan. They expelled or subjugated the
aborigines of the country, and made themselves masters of the great
islands and the inland and surrounding seas. But their origin and early
history are involved in dense obscurity. They doubtless brought with
them from their earlier dwellings in Asia various myths, legends, and
traditions, and these grew and strengthened amid the simple habits of
life which they adopted in their new island-world. According to a
writer<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in the <i>Westminster Review</i> of July, 1878, Japan is yet, in
more senses than one, a young country. Their language and their
institutions "show us a people still in a very early stage of
development." W. G. Aston holds that the earliest date of accepted
Japanese chronology is A. D. 461, and he says that Japanese history,
properly so called, can not be said to exist previous to A. D. 500. He
regards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> Korean history more trustworthy than that of Japan previous to
that date.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> According to Satow, "everything points to the descent of
the Japanese people in great part from a race of Turanian origin, who
crossed over from the continent by way of the islands Tsushima and Iki,
which form the natural stepping-stones from Korea to Japan."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>But the last twenty-five years have witnessed a most remarkable advance
in the use of modern inventions, and more than any other nation of the
far East have the Japanese displayed both a willingness and an ambition
to improve their condition by means of the ideas and usages of Western
civilization. The war with China in 1894, and that with Russia in
1904-1905, displayed a wisdom, tact, and energy which were a great
surprise to the world. The self-poise, the generosity, the far-sighted
statesmanship exhibited in her concluding terms of peace with her
haughty but defeated enemy, have commanded universal admiration. These
facts make the study of this people's ancient religious cult, which is
still a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> powerful element in the popular life, a matter of no little
interest at the present time.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><b><a name="Section_4" id="Section_4">4. Meaning of the Word Shinto.</a></b> The word Shinto means the "way of the
gods." It came into use when Buddhism was introduced into Japan, and
designates the old, ancestral worship as a way of the gods distinct from
the way of the Buddhists, or of any other rival way of religious life.
The Japanese name is <i>Kami no michi</i>. In its essential elements it is a
commingling of Animism and ancestor-worship. Not only are the spirits of
departed ancestors reckoned among the gods, but there are innumerable
deities of other kind and character. The mountains and valleys, the
rivers and the seas, the trees, the wind, the thunder, the fire, all
moving things and objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> of sense are supposed to have each a deity
within. And these deities seem for the most part to have been regarded
as beneficent powers, and their worship is of a joyous kind.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_5" id="Section_5">5. Sources of Information.</a></b> The sources of our knowledge of this ancient
cult are quite numerous, but not as accessible to English and American
students as is desirable. The oldest existing monument of Japanese
literature is known as the "Ko-ji-ki," the text of which would make a
book about the size of our four Gospels. It contains 180 short sections
or chapters. The word <i>Ko-ji-ki</i> means a "Record of Ancient Matters,"
and appropriately designates this oldest known record of the mythology,
history, and customs of the people of Japan. It is the nearest approach
to a sacred scripture of the Shinto cult which we possess. It has been
translated into English, and supplied with a learned introduction and
many explanatory notes by Basil H. Chamberlain,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> a distinguished
scholar, who has made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> Japanese language, literature, and archæology
a subject of extensive and minute research.</p>

<p>Another and much larger work, comprising thirty books, and containing a
record of much of the same mythology and history as the <i>Ko-ji-ki</i>, is
called the <i>Nihongi</i>, or "Chronicles of Japan."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is a composite of
various elements derived from numerous different sources, and while it
reports in substance the myths and stories of the gods as they are found
in the <i>Ko-ji-ki</i>, it makes no mention of that older work and omits some
things which the older work records. It gives, however, a number and
variety of reports of the myths and traditions, informing us how, in one
ancient writing, it is so and so recorded; in another writing, it is
somewhat differently told. This feature enhances its value for purposes
of comparison among the varying traditions.</p>

<p>This later production lacks the simplicity and originality of the
<i>Ko-ji-ki</i>, and bears abundant evidence of the Chinese influences under
which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> was composed. It is written for the most part in Chinese, and
exhibits numerous examples of the learning and philosophical cast of
thought peculiar to certain well-known Chinese writings. As a specimen
of this rationalistic type of construing the ancient myths of creation,
we here cite the opening sentences from the first book of the <i>Nihongi</i>:</p>

<p>"Of old, Heaven and Earth were not yet separated, and the In and Yo [or
<i>Yin</i> and <i>Yang</i>, female and male principles] not yet divided. They
formed a chaotic mass, like an egg, which was of obscurely defined
limits and contained germs. The purer and clearer part was thinly drawn
out and formed Heaven, while the heavier and grosser element settled
down and became Earth. The finer element easily became a united body,
but the consolidation of the heavy and gross element was accomplished
with difficulty. Heaven was therefore formed first, and Earth was
established subsequently. Thereafter Divine Beings were produced between
them. Hence it is said that when the world began to be created, the
soil, of which lands were composed, floated about in a manner which
might be compared to the floating of a fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> sporting on the surface of
the water. At this time a certain thing was produced between Heaven and
Earth. It was in form like a reed-shoot. Now this became transformed
into a god, and was called <i>Kuni-toko-tachi no Mikoto</i>
["Land-eternal-stand-of-august thing"]. Next there was
<i>Kuni-no-sa-tsuchi</i> ["land-of-right-soil"], and next, <i>Toyo-kumu-nu</i>
["rich-form-plain"]&mdash;in all, three deities. These were pure males,
spontaneously developed by the operation of the principle of Heaven"
[the Yo, male principle].</p>

<p>The <i>Ko-ji-ki</i> was written about 712 A. D., and the <i>Nihongi</i> in 720 A.
D., and they are both remarkable for the naïve and peculiar manner in
which they unite together in their narratives matters of traditional
mythology and of history without apparent consciousness of any
noteworthy differences between the two. Besides these remarkable books
there is a Code of ceremonial laws, in fifty volumes, known as the
<i>Yengishiki</i>, which was published A. D. 927. It includes a large number
of ancient Japanese rituals, called <i>Norito</i>, of which several have been
translated into English and provided with a commentary and learned notes
by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> Ernest Satow and Karl Florenz.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> There is also an interesting
collection of ancient poems, called the <i>Manyoshu</i>, "Collection of
Myriad Leaves," which furnishes numerous pictures of the life of the
early Japanese, both before and after the time of the compilation of the
<i>Ko-ji-ki</i> and the <i>Nihongi</i>. There are also the voluminous writings of
the three famous Shinto scholars, Mabuchi, Motowori, and Hirata, who
flourished between the middle of the eighteenth and the middle of the
nineteenth century, and effected an intellectual revolution and a
remarkable revival of the Shinto cult.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><b><a name="Section_6" id="Section_6">6. Japanese Cosmogony and Mythology.</a></b> Our study of Shinto may well begin
by a brief notice of Japanese cosmogony as presented at the very
beginning of the <i>Ko-ji-ki</i>:</p>

<p>"I, Yasumaro, say: Now when chaos had be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>gun to condense, but force and
form were not yet manifest, and there was naught named, naught done, who
could know its shape? Nevertheless Heaven and Earth first parted, and
the Three Deities performed the commencement of creation; the Passive
and Active Essences then developed, and the Two Spirits became the
ancestors of all things. Therefore did he [Izanagi] enter obscurity and
emerge into light, and the Sun and Moon were revealed by the washing of
his eyes; he floated on and plunged into the sea-water, and heavenly and
earthly Deities appeared through the ablutions of his person. So in the
dimness of the great beginning, we, by relying on the original teaching,
learn the time of the conception of the earth and of the birth of
islands; in the remoteness of the original beginning, we by trusting the
former sages, perceive the era of the genesis of Deities and of the
establishment of men."</p>

<p>This brief fragment from the compiler's "Preface" furnishes a condensed
outline of what we read in the first part of the <i>Ko-ji-ki</i>, and it
indicates the peculiar cosmogony of the Japanese mythology. The early
sections of the book record<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> the names of the first deities, who are
said to have been "born alone, and hid their persons;" which seems to
mean that they came into being in some exceptional way, and then
disappeared. Then followed what are termed "the Seven Divine
Generations," among which we find such names as "the
Earthly-eternally-standing-Deity," "the Mud-Earth-Lord, and his younger
sister, the Mud-Earth-Lady;" "the Germ-Integrating Deity, and his
younger sister, the Life-Integrating Deity." These seven generations of
gods end with the birth of a brother and sister, named <i>Izanagi</i> and
<i>Izanami</i> (<i>i. e.</i>, "the male-who-invites and the female-who-invites").
These two are commanded by the higher and more ancient heavenly deities
to "make, consolidate, and give birth to this drifting land;" whereupon
they two, "standing upon the floating Bridge of Heaven, pushed down a
jewelled spear, and stirred the ocean brine till it became thick and
sticky;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and then, drawing the spear upward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> the brine that dropped
down from the end of the spear became an island." Upon this island
Izanagi and Izanami descended from the Heaven above, and in course of
time generated all the islands of the Japanese world. When they had
finished giving birth to countries they proceeded to give birth to
deities, and so by them were begotten fourteen islands and thirty-five
deities. There is little room to doubt that Izanagi and Izanami are a
mythological representation of the generative powers of nature; but
their portraiture in the Japanese literature has probably received some
coloring from Chinese influence and thought.</p>

<p>But in giving birth to the deity of fire, Izanami died, and her brother
buried her, and drawing his mighty sword he proceeded to cut off the
head of his son, the deity of fire. Whereupon, wonderful to tell,
sixteen deities were born from the blood and the different parts of the
body of the fire-god. Among the names of these we find such titles as
"Rock-splitter," "Root-splitter," "Brave-snapping," and
"Possessor-of-Mountains;" and the name of the sword which cleft the
head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> of the fire-god was "Heavenly," or
"Majestic-Point-Blade-Extended."</p>

<p>After the birth of these deities, Izanagi longed to see again his sister
and spouse, and went to seek her in the underworld. He called to her and
asked her to come back to him. She answered that such was her desire,
but she must consult the deities of Hades, and she bade him wait,
saying, "Look not at me." One can not help comparing here the Greek myth
of Orpheus and Eurydice. Orpheus descended into the lower world, charmed
Pluto with his lyre, and obtained permission for his wife Eurydice to
return, following behind him, but only on condition that Orpheus should
not look back at her till they had both reached the upper world. He grew
impatient, looked back to see if she were indeed following, and she at
once vanished from his sight. According to the Japanese myth, however,
Izanagi grew tired of waiting outside, made a light and entered, and was
shocked to behold maggots swarming over her body, and eight
thunder-deities dwelling in her rotting form where they had been born.
He turned and fled back, but she pursued him with the forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> of the
underworld. He succeeded in driving them all back, and with a mighty
rock blocked up the pass of Hades. Then he went to purify himself by
bathing in a stream, and from his staff, and girdle, and bracelet, and
various garments, and from the filth which he contracted in the
underworld were born a multitude of deities, bearing composite names of
strange significance. There was also born, as he washed his left eye, a
deity who was called "the Heaven-Shining-Great-August One;" and from his
right eye was born the "Moon-Night-Possessor," and as he washed his nose
there was born <i>Susa-no-Wo</i>, "Impetuous-Male-Deity."</p>

<p>But we need not pursue further this seemingly "endless genealogy" of the
deities. We are told in section xxx that in a divine assembly of eight
hundred myriad deities it was decided to send one of their number to
govern "the Central Land of Reed-Plains," and subdue the "savage Earthly
Deities." Various deities were sent, and at length a grandchild of the
Sun-Goddess<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>came the Ruler of the Empire, and bears the composite
name of <i>Kamu-yamato-ihare-biko</i>, but is commonly called by his
"canonical name," <i>Jimmu</i>, a title given him long after his decease.
From such heavenly origin sprang all the Emperors of Japan, and the
present Mikado, like all his predecessors, is thus conceived as an
offspring of Heaven, a direct descendant of the ancient heavenly
deities. The significance of this fact will appear conspicuously when we
come to notice more particularly the essential elements in the Shinto
cult.</p>

<p>On this remarkable cosmogony and mythology we do well at this point to
offer the following observations:</p>

<p>(1) These accounts of the origin of the Japanese Archipelago and its
rulers are regarded as <i>genuine traditions handed down from former
ages</i>. One part of the tradition is that the Emperor, who took pains to
have the old records carefully looked after, employed a person living in
his household, who was gifted with marvelous memory; "he could repeat
without mistake the contents of any document he had ever seen, and never
forgot anything that he had heard;" and from the lips of this man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> of
prodigious memory the scribe Yasumaro wrote down the contents of the
<i>Ko-ji-ki</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>(2) Notice, in the next place, that the island world of <i>Japan is all
the world</i> which these records know anything about. The universe of this
cosmogony consists of "the islands of the Central-Land of the
Reed-Plains," with their inland and surrounding seas, and "the Plain of
High Heaven," which, however, was not conceived as very far away above
them.</p>

<p>(3) The entire description of the beginnings of heaven, and earth, and
gods, and men accords with the idea of a continuous process of
evolution. The first three heavenly deities "were born alone, and hid
their persons," or disappeared. All the other deities are spoken of as
begotten, or born, and the deities give birth to the different islands
of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) The world-idea of this old mythology is in notable keeping with the
ancestor worship, and the Animism which enter so largely into the Shinto
faith. In spite of all the wars and discords of the deities, this a
primordial monism, so to speak, at the basis of Japanese cosmogony, and
of all its diverse generations of the heavens and the earth; and yet
there is no one Supreme Ruler in all the Pantheon of eight hundred
myriad gods. When a great council of the gods assembles in the bed of
the Tranquil Heavenly River, no one deity is chief among them, and we
are at a loss to imagine who has authority to call them together or to
preside over the assembly. Izanagi seems for a while to be the chief
creator and ruler, but after a time he disappears, and the Sun Goddess,
his daughter Amaterasu, has her heavenly domain shaken and ravaged by
her younger brother, but is avenged by the heavenly assembly of gods,
who fine and punish the offender, "and expel him with a divine
expulsion." So the Sun Goddess maintains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> her dominion by the help of
the eight hundred myriad gods, no one of whom is invested with supreme
power. It appears from certain poems of the <i>Manyoshu</i> that the moon as
well as the sun was extensively worshiped among the primitive
Japanese.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>(5) It accords with all these ideas that the devotees of the "pure
Shinto" faith trace all their history back to the age of the gods, and
recognize some deity in, or back of, all phenomena. Japan is the country
of the gods; every Japanese is a descendant or offspring of the gods,
and the Mikado is the direct descendant of the imperial line which has
continued in unbroken succession from the beginning of the world. Japan
is, therefore, superior to all other countries, and the Japanese, being
thus directly from the gods, are superior in every respect to other
people. Sprung from the gods, they need no codes of moral law (like the
Chinese), for they are naturally perfect, and do the right things
spontaneously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a name="Section_7" id="Section_7">7. The Japanese a Self-centered People.</a></b> The Japanese people, with such
traditions and such a faith, would naturally be a self-centered people,
and they conceived their island-empire as occupying the summit of the
earth. The Mikado is the Son of Heaven, entitled and empowered to reign
perpetually over the land and the sea. But as all the people are
descendants of the gods, and the islands and all that is in them have
also been begotten of the gods, it follows that the worship of ancestors
is a worship of all the gods of whom they have knowledge, and all the
lower animate and inanimate things in the world are also in some way
instinct with the deities from whom they were born, and whose they are.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the honoring of the gods is a fundamental thing in the
Shinto thought and in the Japanese civilization and government. Every
loyal subject of the Mikado's Empire is expected to be true to the
ancient faith. It is assumed that religion and worship and the proper
administration of government are all essential to each other. The
Japanese word (<i>Matsuri-goto</i>), which is used to denote the art of
government, means, literally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> <i>worshiping</i>. And it is a common thought
and saying: "Everything in the world depends on the spirit of the gods
of heaven and earth, and therefore the worship of the gods is a matter
of primary importance. The gods who do harm are to be appeased, so that
they may not punish those who have offended them; and all the gods are
to be worshiped, so that they may be induced to increase their
favors."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> One of the rules which all the ministers of the Mikado
emphasized in the old times, before the introduction of Buddhism into
Japan, was, "First serve the gods, and afterwards deliberate on matters
of government."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><b><a name="Section_8" id="Section_8">8. Essence of the Shinto Cult.</a></b> From what we have now stated it is to be
seen that reverence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> and worship of the ancestors of the Japanese, and
the recognition of the Mikado's divinity as the incarnation and earthly
representation of the celestial gods, constitute the essence of the
Shinto cult. All the Japanese are offsprings of the gods, but the
imperial "Sovran Grandchild" of <i>Amaterasu</i>, the Sun-Goddess,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> is
pre-eminently divine and worshipful. The first Mikado, however, was not
the real son of <i>Amaterasu</i>, according to the mythic tradition of the
prehistoric time, but her nephew, the son of <i>Oshi-ho-mi-mi</i>, whom she
adopted as her son. But the title of "Sovran Grandchild," having been
applied first to the founder of the Mikado's dynasty, came in time to be
the common title of all the Mikado's successors. The imperial worship,
accordingly, represents the most conspicuous national form of the Shinto
cult.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_9" id="Section_9">9. The Great Sanctuaries.</a></b> The Mikado's palace would, accordingly, be the
most holy shrine of the national worship, the private and exclusive
sanctuary of the imperial ancestors. But the most notable shrine of the
Sun-Goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> is not now the residence of the Mikado. On account of some
great calamity that occurred far back in prehistoric times, her worship
was removed to a separate temple, and was finally established in the
province of Isè, in which the temples, called the "Two great divine
Palaces," are the resort of thousands of pilgrims every year, and,
though not the most ancient, are regarded as first among all the Shinto
temples in the land.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> These two divine palaces, or temples, called
<i>Geku</i> and <i>Naiku</i>, are about three miles apart, and stand in the midst
of groves of aged cryptomeria trees.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> They are approached through
archways (called <i>torii</i>, or <i>toriwi</i>) of simple construction. The
<i>Geku</i> temple is an irregular oblong structure, 247 feet wide at the
front, but only 235 feet wide in the rear; while the side to the right
of the entrance is 339 feet, and that on the left is 335. Within this
large enclosure are others of similar structure, all made of the wood of
cryptomeria trees, and left unpainted and without ornamentation. The
va<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>rious buildings of the temples are thus fashioned after the manner of
the simple huts, or dwellings of the earliest inhabitants of these
islands. Some of the buildings are covered with thatched roofs and have
their walls and doors made of rough matting. Mr. Satow, who has visited
and described the temples of Isè, says that "All the buildings which
form part of the two temples are constructed in a style that is
disappointing in its simplicity and perishable nature.... None but those
which are roofed with thatch are entitled to be considered as being in
strict conformity with the principles of genuine Shinto temple
architecture."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The perishable nature of these temples is such that
it becomes necessary, and is, in fact, the standing rule, to rebuild
them every twenty years. Two sites for each temple are used
alternatively; they lie close to each other, so that the new building is
constructed and ready for use before the old one is removed.</p>

<p>The temple which, though less venerated than those at Isè, is the
shrine-center of the more ancient Shinto cult, is the one at Kitzuki, in
the an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>cient province of Idzumo. These famous shrines of Isè and Kitzuki
represent the two supreme cults of Shinto; namely, that of the
Sun-Goddess, <i>Amaterasu</i>, and that of <i>Oho-kuni-nushi</i>, offspring of the
brother of the Sun-Goddess, who became the ruler of the unseen world of
the spirits of the dead. But there are many other great temples
maintained in whole or in part from the imperial revenues. Some are of
greater sanctity and renown than others, but those of Isè and Kitzuki
are the most celebrated, and every Shinto worshiper is expected, at
least once in his lifetime, to make a pilgrimage himself, or send a
deputy to one of these most famous shrines.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_10" id="Section_10">10. Five Noteworthy Objects Connected with the Worship.</a></b> One noteworthy
fact is the absence of images from the pure Shinto temples; that is,
images exposed as objects of worship. But there is a number of objects
connected with these sacred places which should receive brief notice:</p>

<p>(1) There is, first, the wooden archway (called <i>torii</i>, or <i>toriwi</i>)
through which one passes in approaching the temples. It consists of two
upright posts set in the ground on the tops of which is laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> a long
straight beam, the two ends of which project a little beyond the
uprights. Under this top beam is another horizontal beam connecting the
two side posts after the manner of a girder. According to Satow, "The
<i>toriwi</i> was originally a perch for the fowls offered up to the gods,
not as food, but to give warning at daybreak. It was erected on any side
of the temple indifferently. In later times, not improbably after the
introduction of Buddhism, its original meaning was forgotten, and it was
placed in front only and supposed to be a gateway."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>(2) Opposite the various entrances to the temples is placed a wooden
screen, or fence, called <i>Banpei</i>, which serves as in other dwellings to
guard and hide the privacy of the interior.</p>

<p>(3) Another object of special interest is the <i>Go-hei</i>, a slender wand,
originally a branch of the sacred tree called <i>sakaki</i>. From the Go-hei
hang two long slips of white paper notched on the opposite sides. These
wands of unpainted wood are supposed to represent offerings of white
cloth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> to have the power of attracting the gods to the places where
they are kept.</p>

<p>(4) The offerings presented consist of cups of water and small vessels
filled with rice, vegetables, fruits, salt, fish, birds, and other
simplest products of the land and of the sea. It is noteworthy that we
find no bloody sacrificial rites in Shinto worship, in which one life,
animal or human, was made a vicarious substitute for a guilty soul.</p>

<p>(5) The sacred <i>mirror</i>, which figures in the mythology of the
Sun-Goddess, and is said to have been once used to entice her from a
cave into which she had hid herself in a spell of anger, is carefully
guarded in one of these temples, and also many copies of the mirror.
"Each mirror is contained in a box which is furnished with eight
handles, four on the box itself and four on the lid. The box rests on a
low stand and is covered with a piece of cloth said to be white silk.
The mirror itself is wrapped in a brocade bag, which is never opened or
renewed, but when it begins to fall to pieces from age, another bag is
put on, so that the actual covering consists of numerous layers. Over
the whole is placed a sort of cage of unpainted wood with orna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>ments
said to be of pure gold, and over this again is thrown a sort of curtain
of coarse silk, descending to the floor on all sides."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> One can not
read this description of the sacred mirror thus secretly guarded in a
costly box without being reminded of the sacred ark of the Levitical
sanctuary, and its enclosed "tables of testimony."</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_11" id="Section_11">11. The Ancestor Worship.</a></b> We have already observed that ancestor worship
is the basis of the Shinto cult. This kind of worship is also
conspicuous among the Chinese, and is held by many writers to have been
the original cult of all civilized races and peoples. It began, they
tell us, with a belief in ghosts, and at the first there was no clear
distinction between ghosts and gods. The departed spirit was thought of
as abiding near the place where the dead body was deposited, and the
earliest shrines would therefore be the graves or tombs of the dead.
Later thought would beget the idea that the invisible spirits were
present to witness the acts, and share the joys and sorrows of the
living. And this fundamental idea would, of course, develop into many
diverse conceptions and practices among the different tribes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>Without here discussing this theory of aboriginal religious thought and
practice, as applicable to all peoples, we may note that it accords with
the facts of Japanese history and civilization so far as we can now
trace them back into the mists of prehistoric time.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> We have seen
that Japanese history and mythology run together and blend in remarkable
artlessness as they stand recorded in the oldest literature (<i>e. g.</i>,
the <i>Ko-ji-ki</i> and the <i>Nihongi</i>). Unthinkable monstrosities of the
origin of gods and lands and men are told with the same simplicity as
the unquestionable facts of historic times. But taking the one leading
thought which runs through all these records and appears to be
fundamental in the Japanese civilization&mdash;namely, that all their islands
and emperors and chiefs and people are offspring of the gods, the very
first of whom were somehow self-evolved from the primordial elements of
the universe&mdash;we look upon the Shinto worship as it exists in its purest
form to-day, and note the most apparent facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Lafcadio Hearn, in his "attempt at an interpretation" of Japan, has,
more clearly than any other writer I have consulted, described the
Shinto ancestor-worship under its three forms of <i>Domestic</i>, <i>Communal</i>,
and <i>State</i> cults. In every case it is a worship of the dead, but the
individual, whether he be the most obscure servant, the influential
citizen, the commanding chieftain, or even the Mikado, is but a part and
parcel of the body politic. There is a most remarkable unity of popular
and national life. Government and religion are virtually identical, and
there is no distinction between religion and morality. Obedience and
conformity to the rules of family life, and to the customs of society
and the requirements of the State&mdash;these are the simple sum-total of
Shinto law and gospel. The individual must always stand ready to be
sacrificed for the good of the community or of the State. Everything is
to be regarded as public, and must serve the public weal. There is no
such thing as privacy, and oddities have no respectable standing.
Tradition and custom seem to constitute the essence of religion as well
as of family, communal, and more public life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> There is no code of moral
law; there is nothing in the worship that is fairly comparable to what
we understand by dogma, creed, or Church. Strictly speaking, this system
has no heaven or hell, no deep sense of sin, and no concept of
mediatorial redemption from sin and evil. The dead&mdash;all the dead of all
the ages&mdash;are conceived as somehow living in the unseen vacancy around,
above, below; they are present at the worship; they haunt the tombs;
they are interested in the life and works of their descendants; they
visit their former homes and attend the family worship there; their
happiness, in fact, depends upon the honor and worship which their
living descendants pay them; and also the happiness and prosperity of
the living is believed to depend upon their sense of filial duty and
proper reverence toward the dead. Furthermore, all the dead are supposed
to become gods and attain to supernatural power. But there is no one
Supreme Deity; no central throne of God; no paradise of heavenly
blessedness. So far as any ideas of this kind obtain among the people,
they may be regarded as later conceptions introduced by missionaries or
adherents of other religious sys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>tems. But the cult implies beyond
question a belief in some kind of future life. The <i>Yomi</i>, or Hades, of
Shinto mythology, into which Izanagi went to seek his lost sister, was
conceived as "a hideous and polluted land," and even the realm of the
unseen heavenly deities was never longed for by the devotees of Shinto.
Dooman observes that "to the Japanese mind and imagination Japan, as a
place of residence, was far superior to heaven, and its inhabitants a
far more desirable society than those living in the transcendent
regions. We see that every god who is sent from heaven to Japan on some
important business by the divine assembly marries, and is utterly
unwilling to go back once more to the place from which he
descended."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><b><a name="Section_12" id="Section_12">12. Elements of Animism.</a></b> The ancestor-worship of Shinto can not be
disassociated altogether from the elements of Animism which appear in
the names and titles of certain deities, and also in the fact that there
are "evil gods" and demons who are capable of working mischief and
calamity in the family, the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>munity, and the State. How these evil
deities originated is matter of myth, legend, and speculation. Bad men
would naturally be supposed to carry their evil character with them into
the unseen world of the dead, and to have the same power to work harm
among the living as the good spirits have to bestow benefits. But human
spirits would hardly be supposed to become deities of the wind, and the
thunder, and the waves, and the mountains; of the trees, and the fire,
and the sun, and the moon, and the autumn, and the food of men. Here the
old mythology of the <i>Ko-ji-ki</i> comes in to tell us of a prehistoric and
cosmical origin of evils. When Izanagi went to find his sister Izanami
in the hideous and polluted underworld, and found her body swarming with
maggots and eight thunder deities dwelling in the different parts of her
decaying form, he fled back in astonishment and awe, and she in a rage
of shame pursued him with all the horrid forces of that nether sphere.
He escaped, but not without contracting much pollution on his august
person, and when he sought to wash and cleanse himself in the waters of
a certain river, there were born from the filth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> of his person two
deities, named "the wondrous deity of eighty evils," and "the wondrous
deity of great evils." These evil gods afterwards multiplied, and may be
supposed to be the authors of all the demons, goblins, and mischievous
spirits of evil that disturb the world and its inhabitants. But there
are also good spirits innumerable that animate all moving things. The
winds and the waters, the songs of birds and the hum of the bees, the
growing plants and trees, are all instinct with a sort of conscious
life, and the spirits that live and move in them are to be recognized
and reverenced by prayers and offerings.</p>

<p>The spirits of dead ancestors and the powerful spirits of the winds and
the storms and the growths of nature may or may not have been supposed
to have concert of action understood between them. The Japanese mind
seems never to have elaborated any formal philosophy of this life or any
specific theories of the life to come.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_13" id="Section_13">13. The Domestic Cult.</a></b> The simplest and most original form of the Shinto
worship is that of the family. In the inner chamber of every home there
is a high shelf against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> the wall called the "Shelf of the August
Spirits." Upon it is placed a miniature temple, in which are deposited
little tablets of white wood bearing the names of the deceased members
of the household. These are often spoken of as "spirit sticks" and
"spirit substitutes." Before these household shrines simple offerings
are offered daily and a few words of prayer are spoken. The ceremony is
a very short one, but as regular as the coming of the day. It is usually
performed by the head of the family, but it frequently devolves upon the
woman, the mother or the grandmother, rather than the father. "No
religion," says Hearn, "is more sincere, no faith more touching than
this domestic worship, which regards the dead as continuing to form a
part of the household life and needing still the affection and the
respect of their children and kindred. Originating in those dim ages
when fear was stronger than love, ... the cult at last developed into a
religion of affection; and this it yet remains. The belief that the dead
need affection, that to neglect them is a cruelty, that their happiness
depends upon duty, is a belief that has almost cast out the primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
fear of their displeasure. They are not thought of as dead: they are
believed to remain among those who loved them. Unseen, they guard the
home and watch over the welfare of its inmates; they hover nightly in
the glow of the shrine-lamp, and the stirring of its flame is the motion
of them.... From their shrine they observe and hear what happens in the
house; they share the family joys and sorrows. They were the givers of
life; they represent the past of the race, and all its sacrifices....
Yet, how little do they require in return! Scarcely more than to be
thanked, as founders and guardians of the home, in simple words like
these: 'For aid received, by day and by night, accept, august ones, our
reverential gratitude.'"<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><b><a name="Section_14" id="Section_14">14. The Communal Cult.</a></b> The next phase of the Shinto worship to be
noticed is that which is represented in the temples scattered about
everywhere in the land and which are said to number over 195,000 at the
present time. In every community, village, and large city is found the
parish-temple, and in the larger towns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> each section or district has its
public shrine, in which the whole community honor the deified ancestors
of certain noble families of ancient time, or the spirit of the first
great patriarch of the clan. The farmers, or those who till the fields,
usually dwell in a village on the principal highway, and go out thence
to work the rural districts round about. So the villages vary in size
from fifty houses set on a single street half a mile long to a large
town of many hundred houses. In Simmons and Wigmore's "Notes on Land
Tenure and Local Institutions in Old Japan,"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> we read that the
Japanese rural population is, as a rule, "exceedingly stable. The
villagers are for the most part engaged wholly or partially as
cultivators of land, and in the vast majority of cases many generations
of cultivators have been born and have died on the same spot. From the
almost numberless replies to inquiries, the answer usually is, 'We do
not know where our ancestors came from, or when they came to live on
this spot. Our temple register may tell, but we have never thought about
the matter.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>The deity honored at these village temples is called the <i>Ujigami</i>, and
recognized as the patriarchal and tutelary god of the community. Just
whether he were the clan-ancestor of the first settlers in that
particular parish, or the spirit of some mighty ruler of that district
at a former time, or the patron-god of some noble family once resident
there, is as uncertain as the knowledge of the common villagers touching
their earliest progenitors. But in every class these <i>Ujigami</i> were
worshiped as the tutelar deity of the community in which the temple
stood. Also, in the larger towns there are Shinto temples dedicated to
certain patron-gods of other localities.</p>

<p>Each one of these parish temples naturally has a most intimate relation
to the life of the community about it. Thither every child born in the
parish is taken, when a month old, and formally named and placed under
the protection of the ancestral deity. As it grows up it is regularly
taken to observe all the festivals and the processions and ceremonies,
and the temple groves and gardens become its common playground. There is
nothing somber or solemn about this religious cult to scare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> a child,
but rather very much to attract and interest.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Every village temple
has its appointed days of public worship, and neighboring districts vie
with each other in making their great festival days occasions of popular
delight. To these joyous festivals every family contributes according to
ability, and the worship is accompanied by public amusements of various
kinds, athletic sports, and the sale of toys for children. The temple
worship consisted in the presentation of offerings of cloth, herbs,
fruits, and other of the most common products of the country, and in a
ritual prayer enumerating the various gifts and supplicating for
prosperity and success in all communal affairs, for protection against
sickness, plague, and famine, and for the triumph of their chieftains in
time of war. In this way the <i>Ujigami</i> was recognized as the tutelar
deity of the community and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> district, the abiding friend and helper
of his offspring. The communal cult thus powerfully confirmed the family
cult, and enforced the lesson that no man could live unto himself alone.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_15" id="Section_15">15. The National Cult.</a></b> But it is in the State or National observances of
the great temples that the Shinto worship is seen in its most elaborated
form. The substance and manner of this worship may be learned from the
ancient Japanese rituals, which make mention of the chief deities,
enumerate the offerings that are presented at the sacred shrines, and
furnish us the very language employed "in the presence of the sovran
gods." How early these rituals of worship were committed to writing is
an open question, but it is altogether probable that in substance they
had been transmitted orally through many generations before they were
put in written form. From these rituals, and the practices of the
worship as they may be observed at the present time, we are able to
learn the chief features of the service.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>In connection with this national worship we may here note (1) that the
great festivals and occasions of worship were observed in all the
principal temples at the same time; (2) the <i>Yengishiki</i> mentions 3,132
shrines distinguished as great and small; there were 492 great shrines,
and 2,640 small ones. But besides these there were many thousands of
smaller, undistinguished temples scattered all over the lands. (3) These
various shrines were dedicated to a great number of deities, and there
were many gods who received worship in a number of temples at one and
the same time. (4) The offerings were made in the name of "the Sovran
Grandchild" of the sun-goddess, the divine title of every Mikado, and
Satow remarks that "it is difficult to resist the suggestion that the
sun was the earliest among the powers of nature to be deified, and that
the long series of gods who precede her in the cosmogony of the
<i>Ko-ji-ki</i> and <i>Nihongi</i>, most of whom are shown by their names to have
been mere abstractions, were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>vented to give her a genealogy, into
which were inserted two or perhaps more of her own attributes,
personified as separate deities."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> (5) The priesthood seems to have
been for the most part hereditary, and many priests claimed descent from
the chief deity to whom the temple was dedicated. The reader of the
ritual was a member of the priestly tribe which traced its origin to
<i>Oho-nakato-mi</i>, chief of the whole Nakatomi family. Another priestly
family is the Imbibi tribe.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> (6) Virgin priestesses also figure in
the celebration of the great ceremonies of State. Princesses of the
Mikado's family have been consecrated to officiate in the temples of Isè
and in other great temples also. While some of the priestesses are
virgin princesses, some of them also are young, not yet having reached
the nubile age, and when they reach that age they cease to be
priestesses. With others the office is hereditary, as it is with men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and the women of this class retain and exercise their priestly office
after marriage.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_16" id="Section_16">16. The Harvest Service.</a></b> As an example of public worship of exceptional
interest, we take the ritual ceremony for Harvest, which is celebrated
once a year&mdash;the fourth day of the second month. The chief service is at
the capital, but the festival is observed in all the provinces under the
direction of the local rulers. Preparations go on for a fortnight
beforehand, and the service begins twenty minutes before seven in the
morning. At the capital, in the large court used for the worship of the
Shinto gods, the ministers of State assemble, along with the priests and
priestesses of many temples which are supported from the Mikado's
treasury. When all things are in readiness, the ministers, priests, and
priestesses enter in succession and occupy the places assigned them. The
various offerings are duly presented and the ritual is read. At the
conclusion of each section of the ritual as recited by the reader, all
the priests respond, "O!" (Yes, or Amen.)</p>

<p>The following is a portion of the ritual used on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> one of these
occasions: "Hear, all of you, assembled priests of higher and lower
order. I declare in the presence of the sovran gods<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> whose praises
are fulfilled as heavenly temples and country temples.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> I fulfill
your praises by setting up the great offerings of the sovran
grandchild's augustiness, made with intention of deigning to begin the
harvest in the second month of this year, as the morning sun rises in
glory. I declare in the presence of the sovran gods of the harvest: If
the sovran gods will bestow in many-bundled ears and in luxuriant ears
the late-ripening harvest which they will bestow, the late-ripening
harvest which will be produced by the dripping of foam from the arms and
by drawing the mud together between the opposite thighs, then I will
fulfill their praises by setting up the first fruits in a thousand ears,
and many hundred ears, raising high the beer-jars, filling them, and
ranging them in rows." The ritual goes on to specify, among the
offerings, sweet and bitter herbs, "things which dwell in the blue
sea-plain;" clothes bright, and glittering, and soft, and coarse; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
white horse, a white boar, and a white cock. The names also of many
deities are declared: the "divine Producer," the "great Goddess of
Food," "wonderful-rock-Gate," "the from-heaven-shining-great Deity who
sits in Isè," "sovran gods who sit in the Farms," "sovran gods who sit
in the mouths of the mountains," and those "who dwell in the partings of
the waters."</p>

<p>As soon as the reader had finished the words of the ritual, he retired,
and the priests distributed the various offerings and presented them to
the gods for whom they were set apart.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_17" id="Section_17">17. The Great Purification.</a></b> But the ritual of the Great or General
Purification is said to be "one of the most important and most solemn
ceremonies of the Shinto religion." Professor Karl Florenz, who has
given us a translation of this ritual,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> informs us that it is by
means of this ceremony that "the population of the whole country, from
the princes and ministers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> down to the common people, is purified and
freed from sins, pollutions, and calamities." It is celebrated twice a
year, on the thirtieth day of the sixth and twelfth months. "The chief
ceremony was performed in the capital, near the south gate of the
imperial palace, and might be styled the purification of the court,
because it was to purify all the higher and lower officials of the
imperial court. In a similar way the ceremony was celebrated also at all
the more important public shrines of the whole country." Besides the
regular semiannual celebration of the "Great Purification" (called
<i>Oho-harahe</i>), it is also performed on such special occasions as at the
accession of a new emperor to the throne, or when an imperial princess
was chosen as a virgin priestess and sent to the temple of Isè.</p>

<p>Without detailing the movements, positions, and practices of the
assembled priests, officials, and common people at the service of the
General Purification, we simply cite a few extracts from the ritual
which may serve to show us the underlying concept of purification. While
the ritual is only a part of the entire ceremony of the occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>sion, we
are told that it is not infrequently recited without performing the
ceremony. Moreover, while in ancient times the reader was always a
member of the priestly Nakatomi tribe, at the present time the ritual is
read by the officiating priest of each particular temple. The following
excerpts are made from Florenz's translation:</p>

<p>"Hear, all of you, assembled princes of the blood, princes, high
dignitaries, and men of the hundred offices. Hear, all of you, that in
the Great Purification of the present last day of the sixth month of the
current year, [the Sovran] deigns to purify, and deigns to cleanse the
various offenses which may have been committed either inadvertently, or
deliberately, especially by the persons serving in the imperial court:
(viz.) the scarf-wearing attendants, the sash-wearing attendants (of the
kitchen), the attendants who carry quivers on the back, the attendants
who gird on swords, the eighty attendants of the attendants, and,
moreover, by the people serving in all offices."</p>

<p>The ritual goes on to declare how the Sovran's dear progenitors, in a
divine assembly, ordained that the "Sovran Grandchild's Augustiness
should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> tranquilly rule the luxuriant reed-plain region of fresh young
spikes as a peaceful country;" how they expelled with a divine expulsion
the savage deities, and "silenced the rocks and trunks of trees;" how
they let him go down from his heavenly place, "and dividing a road
through the eightfold heavenly clouds," they sent him down and gave the
land into his peaceful keeping. The ritual also makes mention of various
kinds of offenses which need to be cleansed and purged away, and
distinguishes them as "heavenly offenses" and "earthly offenses." Among
the former are "breaking down the divisions of the rice fields, filling
up the irrigating channels, and opening the floodgate of sluices," and
the evacuation of one's bowels in improper places. Among "earthly
offenses" are the cutting the skin of the living or the dead body so as
to become defiled by blood, being affected with corns, bunions, boils,
or proud-flesh; sins of adultery, the offense of using incantations, and
various kinds of personal calamity.</p>

<p>"It is expected," the ritual adds, "that the heavenly gods will be
favorably disposed by reason of these offerings, ceremonies, and ritual
of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> Great Purification, and will deign to purify and cleanse, and
make all the specified offenses disappear, even as the clouds of heaven
and the dense morning and evening mists disappear before the blowing
winds." It is expected that "the goddess who resides in the current of
the rapid stream that comes boiling down the ravines, from the tops of
the mountains," and the goddess who resides in the currents of the briny
ocean will carry them away, and "swallow them down with gurgling sound,"
and they shall be utterly "blown away, banished, and got rid of," so
that "from this day onwards there will be no offense in the four
quarters of the region under heaven, especially with regard to all
people of all offices who respectfully serve in the court of the
Sovran." The offenses were thought of as somehow swept away by the winds
and the waves, and then swallowed into the depths of the sea, and so
cast down into the underworld, the realm of death and pollution, whence
all defilements were supposed to have originated. So they were cast down
into the depths whence they came forth.</p>

<p>The concluding words of this ritual are a com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>mand for the "diviners of
the four countries to leave and go away to the great river-way, and
carry away the offenses by purification." Thus divination was honored,
as moving in the will and way of the gods; but incantation is mentioned
among the "earthly offenses." Probably these evil incantations refer to
evil-minded witchcraft and invoking calamity on others.</p>

<p>This great ritual ceremony of purification, being one of the most solemn
formal expressions of the Shinto cult, calls for the following remarks:</p>

<p>(1) The central idea is purification from certain forms of evil, or
certain kinds of offenses.</p>

<p>(2) The offenses are conceived as either willfully committed, or
committed inadvertently.</p>

<p>(3) They are also spoken of as heavenly and earthly. This distinction
seems to us quite arbitrary and unnatural, but it probably had a
mythical origin and the offenses called heavenly are mainly such as
involve distress for an agricultural community. They are sins against
the <i>land</i> of the gods, while the earthly offenses are mainly matters of
personal defilement. In all cases it is conspicuous that the Shinto
concept of offenses which need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> purging away is that of outward physical
pollution and damage. They are all offenses committed against the
interests of the community and likely to bring some kind of calamity
upon the people.</p>

<p>(4) We should also remark that while, according to the ritual of the
Great Purification, it is expected that from that day forwards "no
offense which is called offense" will occur again in the four quarters
of the whole region under heaven, the same ceremony of purification is
repeated every six months&mdash;year in and year out.</p>

<p>(5) These facts serve to show a moral and religious basis for the
Japanese love of cleanliness and the scrupulous care with which these
people of "the luxuriant central land of the ears of fresh rice" study
to keep their bodies, their houses, their temples, and their whole
domain free from all manner of physical impurity.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_18" id="Section_18">18. Other Ritual Services.</a></b> Other rituals for other occasions and
purposes furnish nothing of a different character or of exceptional
importance that we need here give further attention to their various
contents and suggestions. There are, in the voluminous <i>Yen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>gishiki</i>,
rituals for the service of the gods of Kasuga, for the service of the
goddess of food, and of the gods of the wind, and for the service of
particular temples. Some of these services are occasions of grand
ceremonial display. The place, the day, the hour, and all the details of
the service are arranged beforehand. The procession of those who take
part is ordered with extreme precision and made in every way
magnificent. Various orders of officials move along in separate ranks.
The priestess, accompanied by many mantled attendants, is drawn in a
car, and on either side four men in scarlet coats carry a silk umbrella
and a huge, long-handled fan. The female attendants and servants of the
priestess, each a lady of rank, follow in seven carriages. Chests filled
with sacrificial utensils and food offerings, the messenger of the
Mikado and his attendants of rank, have their assigned places in the
procession. Upon arriving at the temple enclosure, the priestess alights
from her car or palanquin, passes into the courtyard behind curtains so
held by her attendants as to hide her from the gaze of the crowd, enters
her private room and changes her traveling dress for the sac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>rificial
robes. Meantime the Mikado's presents and all the other offerings are
duly placed on the tables and in the various chapels prepared for them
and the high officers of State take their seats within the temple
enclosure. All the prescribed forms are observed with scrupulous care,
and the ritual is read. In many services harpists, flute-players,
singers, and dancers perform their several tasks. At the conclusion of
the services the company clap their hands and then separate. The
priestess changes her robes again for her traveling dress, and returns
to her lodging in like stately procession as she came to the shrine.</p>

<p>The mirror, sword, bow, and spear, which are mentioned in the rituals as
presents offered to the gods at the great festivals, doubtless have
their symbolical significance, and like the three divine insignia of
sword, precious stone, and mirror&mdash;the regalia or symbols of Japanese
power and glory&mdash;have doubtless their mythic connection with prehistoric
traditions; but these belong to the study of Japanese antiquities rather
than to the religious elements of Shinto.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a name="Section_19" id="Section_19">19. Influence of China on Japanese Thought.</a></b> So far we have spoken only
of what may be called the original or pure Shinto cult as the religion
of the ancient Japanese. But it is important to observe that the moral
and religious ideas of other peoples and other systems have for some two
thousand years past been affecting the life and thought of the Japanese
people. One noteworthy foreign influence came in from China, and as
early as the first century of the Christian era&mdash;perhaps somewhat
earlier&mdash;Chinese scholars made their way into Japan. This was very
natural, for the proximity of China favored intercourse between the two
nations, and Confucianism was at the beginning of our era five hundred
years old. Ancestor-worship was common to the people of both lands, and
the arts and industries of the two countries might have found
affiliation in many ways we can not now determine. That such a leavening
Chinese influence was early introduced into Japan is simply matter of
fact. The Preface of Yasumaro, the compiler of the most ancient records
of the <i>Ko-ji-ki</i>, shows the effect of Chinese philosophy in its
incidental mention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> "the Passive and Active Essences" which
co-operated at the beginning of the creation; and Chamberlain, in his
Introduction to his English translation of the <i>Ko-ji-ki</i>, observes that
"at the very earliest period to which the twilight of legend stretches
back, Chinese influence had already begun to make itself felt in these
islands, communicating to the inhabitants both implements and ideas."
Then it is to be further remarked that the <i>Nihongi</i>, completed in 720
A. D., although essentially a parallel chronicle of Japanese traditions,
is in thought and style conspicuously Chinese. It is made in every
aspect and element of its composition to resemble as far as possible a
Chinese history.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_20" id="Section_20">20. Influence of Buddhism.</a></b> But a deeper and more widespread influence
than that of anything of Chinese origin was the introduction into Japan
of Buddhism, which was first brought in about A. D. 552, but did not
succeed in leavening the whole country until the middle of the ninth
century. It was quietly propagated by leaders of various Buddhist sects
which differ in minor practices, and slowly it gained as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>cendency, but
its first more notable triumph followed the teaching of Kukai, founder
of the Shingon sect, who so adapted Buddhist doctrines to the
traditional ideas of ancestor worship as to maintain that all the Shinto
deities were <i>avatars</i> or incarnations of Buddha. With great ingenuity
and cunning, a new interpretation was given to ancient myths, and new
constructions were put upon old beliefs. The Shinto gods, rites,
customs, and traditions took on a Buddhist significance, and many of the
mysteries of birth and of death were explained in a manner so simple and
popular as to commend them to all who listened to the new teaching. For
Buddhism had already learned in India and in China the clever art of
appropriating old beliefs and customs and of clothing them with a new
and higher meaning. Confucianism itself had already in part prepared the
way for Buddhism in Japan, and the successful Buddhist propagandists
were wise enough to suppress or keep out of sight all that might be
offensive in their system, and to teach only such forms of doctrine as
could be made attractive to the masses of the people. Kukai thus
suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>ceeded in converting the Mikado to his new interpretations of the
Shinto beliefs, and the new system thus put forward received the name
"Riyobu Shinto," which means "two parts," or the "double way of the
gods," or the twofold divine teaching. So complete and general did this
Riyobu Shinto become in its spread throughout Japan that for a thousand
years it dominated the civilization of the Empire. It had its priests,
its gorgeous temples and ritual services, its philosophy, and its divers
sects, and it is said that there are at least twelve distinct Buddhist
sects in Japan to-day. According to Lafcadio Hearn, "the religion of the
Buddha brought to Japan another and a wider humanizing influence&mdash;a new
gospel of tenderness&mdash;together with a multitude of new beliefs that were
able to accommodate themselves to the old, in spite of fundamental
dissimilarity. In the highest meaning of the term, it was a civilizing
power. Besides teaching new respect for life, the duty of kindness to
animals as well as to all human beings, the consequences of all present
acts upon the conditions of a future existence, the duty of resignation
to pain as the inevitable result of for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>gotten error, it actually gave
to Japan the arts and the industries of China. Architecture, painting,
sculpture, engraving, printing, gardening&mdash;in short, every art and
industry that helped to make life beautiful&mdash;developed first in Japan
under Buddhist teaching."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> To which may well be added the following
statement of Aston: "There was nothing in Shinto which could rival in
attraction the sculpture, architecture, painting, costumes, and ritual
of the foreign faith. Its organization was more complete and effective.
It presented ideals of humanity, charity, self-abnegation, and purity
far higher than any previously known to the Japanese nation."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>But after a thousand years of mixture, who can now tell for certain just
what is original Shinto and what is the Buddhist supplement or
modification? The Buddhism of Japan is as far from the original
teachings of Gautama as the Roman Catholic religion of Spain is from the
simple precepts and practices of Christ and His first apostles. The same
is true of the Buddhism of China and Thibet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> The Shingon sect of
Buddhists in Japan, of which Kukai was the founder, has taken up into
itself many ideas which are neither purely Buddhist nor purely
Shintoist. Superstitions alien to both cults are likely to have found
their way among the people and to have exerted influences on the popular
cult, and no man is now able to point out their origin or their
history.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><b><a name="Section_21" id="Section_21">21. Revival of Pure Shinto.</a></b> We are not here concerned, however, with
Japanese Buddhism. Our inquiry is after the facts and the significance
of the essential Shinto cult. A great and remarkable revival of the
older Shinto began near the beginning of the eighteenth century and
persisted with great success for more than one hundred years. The most
distinguished scholars of Japan were the chief leaders in this reform.
We have already had occasion to mention the names of the three most
famous men among them&mdash;Mabuchi, Motowori, and Hirata. These by their
expositions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> ancient scriptures and traditions turned the tide of
popular thought against Buddhism and Chinese philosophy. It is quite
interesting to note in some of their writings the antipathy and
hostility to Chinese teachings. Motowori had a remarkable answer to
those critics who say that Shintoism knows no moral code. He declared
that all a loyal Japanese subject was concerned to do was simply to obey
the Mikado, whether his commands were right or wrong. He maintained that
morals were invented by the Chinese because they were an immoral people;
but in Japan there was no necessity for any system of morals, as every
Japanese acted aright if he only consulted his own heart.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Whatever
we may think or say of such self-complacency, it accords well with
Japanese religion, mythology, and history, and it is a simple fact to be
noted that in 1871 Buddhism in Japan was disestablished and disendowed,
and the old Shinto was declared to be the national religion. Percival
Lowell observes that this reinstatement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> of the Mikado and the old
national faith is "a curious instance of a religious revival due to
archæological, not to religious zeal."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> But while the old Shinto is at
present the official cult of Japan, it appears to have little life or
force. Japanese Buddhism is said to be showing signs of renewed
activity, and is likely to prove a powerful antagonist of Christianity.
It is certainly a question of vital importance to the future
civilization of Japan which of these mighty rivals shall gain ascendency
over the popular mind.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_22" id="Section_22">22. Esoteric Shinto.</a></b> Shinto did not continue very long to hold its newly
proclaimed status as the State religion. Its own most devoted adherents
and leaders felt that its highest interests would be best served without
official and governmental prestige. A wise and prudent State policy
determined that its permanence and success should be left to care for
themselves and to depend upon the merits of its teachings and its
historic and popular hold upon the national, the communal, and the
family life. As a cult it is deeply rooted in the civilization of the
empire, and its pilgrims swarm along the highways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> of travel and at the
historic shrines. They are found journeying to the summits of sacred
mountains, and there performing esoteric rites which induce mystic
divine possession. The performance of such mystic rites and incantations
seems to be no modern innovation. It may have its connections with
Buddhist counting of rosaries, and possibly other foreign influences
have helped to cultivate its somewhat mantic forms, but its origin is
from a remote antiquity. This "esoteric Shinto" is essentially akin to
that self-induced religious fervor which exhibits itself in many lands
and in connection with various cults, and is often seen among the
Mohammedan dancing and howling dervishes. Its existence and its
practices in Japan refute the notion of those who would deny to Shinto
the character of a real religion.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The excrescences and
extravagancies of religious fervor must have some sort of a religion to
inspire them.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_23" id="Section_23">23. Mingling of Shinto, Confucianism, and Buddhism.</a></b> The noteworthy fact
that Shinto, Confucianism, and Buddhism have for more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> thousand
years mixed with each other in Japan demonstrates the susceptibility of
the Japanese people to foreign influence and teaching, and their natural
hospitality toward the various religious cults. The ethical teachings of
Confucius prepared the way for Buddhism, and, in spite of antipathy and
wars between the nations, maintain a powerful hold upon the thoughtful
Japanese to-day. Still more remarkable is it that millions of the
Japanese appear to accept both Shintoism and Buddhism, and good
Shintoists and good Buddhists may be found worshiping in some temples at
one and the same time.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> A Japanese scholar, speaking at the Chicago
"Parliament of Religions" on the "Future of Religion in Japan," declared
that the three systems named "are not only living together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> on friendly
terms with one another, but, in fact, they are blended together in the
minds of the people. One and the same Japanese is at once a Shintoist, a
Confucianist, and a Buddhist. Our religion may be likened to a triangle.
One angle is Shintoism, another is Confucianism, and a third is
Buddhism, all of which make up the religion of the ordinary Japanese.
Shintoism furnishes the objects, Confucianism offers the rules of life,
while Buddhism supplies the way of salvation."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><b><a name="Section_24" id="Section_24">24. Roman Catholicism in Japan.</a></b> We must not omit altogether a notice of
the introduction of Roman Catholic Christianity into Japan about the
middle of the sixteenth century. It was in 1549 that the famous Jesuit,
Francis Xavier, landed at Kagoshima, and began his marvelous missionary
work through Japanese interpreters, and in two years of strenuous toil
he succeeded in winning many converts from all classes of the people.
Fifty years thereafter the Christian converts throughout the country are
said to have numbered nearly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> million. But the Jesuit habit and policy
of meddling with affairs of State, their intolerance of other cults, and
at length their crusade against the ancient national faith and their
burning of Buddhist temples and slaughter of Buddhist priests, aroused
the bitter reaction and bloody persecutions, which, after some forty
years of struggle, succeeded in obliterating every public sign of
Christianity from every province of the empire. And for over two hundred
years Japan closed her doors to all foreign influences and appeals. It
was not until 1873 that the edicts against Christianity were withdrawn.
Of the Protestant missionary movements in the island empire since that
date, it is not the purpose of this essay to speak.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_25" id="Section_25">25. Present Religious Indifference.</a></b> Much is said nowadays about the
apparent religious indifference of the Japanese. Some writers seem to
think that the Japanese and the Chinese people are alike inferior and
defective in religious nature. Mr. Gulick, in his "Evolution of the
Japanese," reports Marquis Ito, Japan's most illustrious statesman, as
having said: "I regard religion itself as quite unnecessary for a
nation's life; science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> is far above superstition, and what is
religion&mdash;Buddhism or Christianity&mdash;but superstition, and therefore a
possible source of weakness to a nation? I do not regret the tendency to
free thought and atheism, which is almost universal in Japan, because I
do not regard it as a source of danger to the community." And yet this
same distinguished statesman is reported on the same page (288) to have
given utterance to the following much more recent statement: "The only
true civilization is that which rests on Christian principles, and
consequently, as Japan must attain her civilization on these principles,
those young men who receive Christian education will be the main factors
in the development of future Japan." Possibly these two discrepant
statements may be reconciled by supposing that, in the first case, Ito's
thought was turned especially to the superstitions and temporary phases
incident to all religious cults, and in his later remark he spoke of
Christianity as somehow synonymous with Western civilization. But in any
case it would seem that one who deems the Japanese either irreligious,
or non-religious, or deficient in religious sense, ought to explain the
mani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>fold facts of the Shinto cult, such as the "god shelf," the
ancestral tablets, the daily offerings, and the family worship in almost
every household of that Eastern island-empire. What mean the hundreds of
thousands of white-robed pilgrims who annually visit the numerous sacred
shrines? And is there no element of religion in the devout patriotism
that is ever ready to sacrifice life and all that men hold dear for the
faith and inheritance of their beloved "central land of Reed-Plains"
given long ago to the care of the "Sovran Grandchild" by the celestial
deities?</p>

<p>It is only a one-sided concept of religion, and a too prevalent failure
to distinguish between its local temporary phases and its deeper
essentials as grounded in the spiritual nature of man, that have led
superficial observers to deny the profound religious element in the
Shinto and Buddhist worship of Japan. If Paul, waiting at Athens, and
beholding the city full of idols, could truly say, "I perceive, O
Athenians, that in all things ye are very religious," just as truly may
we say, in view of the 195,000 temples and the innumerable deities of
the Shinto cult, that the Japanese are exceedingly religious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Let me add the testimony of Mr. Gulick himself, who spent years in the
country: "The universality of the tokens of family religion, and the
constant and loving care bestowed upon them, are striking testimony to
the universality of religion in Japan. The pathos of life is often
revealed by the family devotion of the mother to these silent
representatives of divine beings, and departed ancestors or children. I
have no hesitation in saying that, so far as external appearances go,
the average home in Japan is far more religious than the average home in
enlightened England or America, especially when compared with such as
have no family worship. There may be a genuine religious life in these
Western homes, but it does not appear to the casual visitor. Yet no
casual visitor can enter a Japanese home, without seeing at once the
evidences of some sort of religious life."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>It is to be remarked that in the history and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> evolution of religion,
where there has been obvious evolution, periods of long peace and
repose, marked by formalism, skepticism, and indifference to religious
obligation, are generally followed by great revivals and reforms. Some
new light breaks in; some great prophet appears; new ideas and hopes
take hold on the popular mind, and thereupon a new era opens in
civilization. The renaissance in Japan of the last fifty years may be
the prelude to an epoch-making revival of the Orient.</p>

<p><b><a name="Section_26" id="Section_26">26. Concluding Observations and Suggestions.</a></b> Our study of Shinto has led
us over a somewhat unfamiliar field of thought. The mythology and the
records of the <i>Ko-ji-ki</i> and the <i>Nihongi</i> are far apart from all our
Western legends and ideals of the early world, and in great part seem
like monstrosities of fantastic speculation. It is affirmed by some that
the Japanese people have been halting for two millenniums in a state of
childhood, receiving nothing from Confucianism or from Buddhism to
quicken or change the national life; but with the introduction of
Western thought and enterprise they have suddenly leaped into
comparative maturity, and their new departure from a dreamy past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> is
likely to astonish the whole world. It is very obvious that the
introduction of modern science into her thousands of elementary schools
must sooner or later undermine all faith in the traditional cosmogony,
and, along with that, a whole world of notions bound up with the Shinto
cult must needs be overthrown. Eminent Japanese scholars say that
Western learning has sounded the knell and signed the death warrant of
the ancient religion of their island-world.</p>

<p>It is for us very easy, in the light of our New Testament revelation, to
point out defects in the Shinto system. Some four or five of these we
may briefly mention as matters which a Christian missionary should keep
in view as evincing the need of preaching among these people the deeper
demands of the religion of Jesus Christ. (1) The first and fundamental
defect in Shinto as a religious system is its lack of any clear or
helpful concept of one God and Father of all. The doctrine of God is
fundamental in any cult, and where the idea is vague and imperfect the
entire system of doctrine and practice must needs possess an element of
uncertainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> and weakness. (2) Another defect is its want of a clear
concept of sin as a moral disease of the heart. The Japanese mind needs
to be turned inward to a deeper sense of the real sinfulness of sin. (3)
Another serious fault in the Japanese civilization is its low estimate
of womanhood. Here as in China woman has not attained her proper sphere.
She is subjected to three forms of obedience, which in actual life are
too abject for her higher development&mdash;she must bow to her parents, to
her husband, and to her son in a manner that involves what we should
call a humiliating form of domestic slavery. Japan needs the practice of
a monogamy of the highest Christian type in order to rectify this
inferior and one-sided view of the male and female constitution of
humanity. (4) There is also in Japan an apparently low estimate of human
life. It is probably due largely to the communal and feudal system which
has for a long time ruled the people. The individual is nothing; the
community is everything. These and other defects show our grounds for
believing that the old order and system must sometime change. But it is
no strange or unheard of thing in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> world for an old order to change
and give place to something new and higher. Western civilization has
seen not a few examples of such changes; but, as touching religious
evolution, what a monumental example we have in the transition from the
Old Testament Judaism to the New Testament kingdom of heaven! The main
contents and scope of the Epistle to the Hebrews point out the fact that
the old covenant, with its sanctuary and altars and tables and
sacrifices and priests, could not make their worshipers perfect.
Notwithstanding its long and glorious history, it waxed old, and when
the Epistle was written it was nigh unto vanishing away (Heb. viii, 13).
It did pass away and give place to a more spiritual cult, the gospel of
peace on earth and universal love. May not the national cult of
Japan&mdash;with its faith in the unseen, its rituals of purification, its
concepts of a heavenly ancestry, and its intimations of deification
after death&mdash;be made to give way before a superior cult that may have
the wisdom to offer a higher and more rational presentation of the
essential truths embodied in the Shinto worship? Whatever men may think
or say about the mystical and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> legendary elements in the Hebrew
Scriptures, no one familiar with the literatures of the nations can
hesitate for a moment to acknowledge the immense superiority of the Old
Testament law and prophets and psalms over the contents of the
<i>Ko-ji-ki</i> and the <i>Nihongi</i>. If, then, the covenants and the rituals of
Judaism waxed old and vanished away before the clearer light and truth
of the teachings of Jesus Christ, much more should we expect that the
same superior "Light of the world" must needs, sometime, supersede and
supplant the rituals of the Shinto cult.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I shall venture to specify sundry elements of ancient
Shinto, which, to use the language of Jesus, are not to be <i>destroyed</i>,
but rather <i>fulfilled</i>, in the higher and more universal truths of the
kingdom of Christ. <i>Fulfilled</i>, I say for I look upon all the religious
longings, and prayers, and penitential psalms of the nations, and their
inquiries after the Unseen and Eternal, as so many foregleams of a
coming Light, destined to enlighten every man that cometh into the
world.</p>

<p>We have seen that one of the most conspicuous aspects of the Shinto cult
is its ceremonial of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> Great Purification. Physical pollution of any
kind is abhorrent to the Japanese. The touch of a dead body, contact
with a foul disease, failure to wash and keep one's person clean, are
regarded as of the nature of calamities. We know that there was much in
the practices and traditions of the Jewish elders that closely resembled
these Shinto ideas of pollution. The Pharisees and scribes found fault
with Jesus because of His indifference to their "washings of cups, pots,
and brazen vessels." But cleanliness, we all admit, is a near neighbor
of godliness. St. Paul said, "Glorify God in your body," for he
maintained that "your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit which is in
you." Jesus found no fault with Jewish ablutions, and enjoined the
highest personal purity. But He pointed out the deeper lesson that the
more horrible defilement of man is a pollution of the heart. "For from
within," He said, "out of the heart of man, evil thoughts proceed,
fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, covetings, wickedness,
deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:&mdash;all
these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man." This, then,
is one fun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>damental truth which the Shinto worshiper should learn from
the teachings of our Lord. The clean body and the pure white robes are
eminently proper and beautiful in their way; but they should symbolize
the consciousness of a pure heart, and a blameless life that keeps
itself "unspotted from the world." Shinto purification needs the
supplement of a deeper knowledge of spiritual defilement in order to a
deeper knowledge of purity.</p>

<p>More exalted than any mere forms of purification, or rituals of worship,
is that notion of a living Presence concealed in all phenomena. There
has been and is to-day among all peoples a belief in many invisible
spirits that have some sort of power over the clouds, the winds, the
waters, the earth, and all its teeming growths. We call it Animism,
Shamanism, and in a certain specific form, Fetishism. Belief in a
countless multitude of spirits who can influence the elements about us
for good or for evil, is firmly rooted in all the ancient peoples of
Eastern Asia, from India to Japan. We have seen how deep a hold it had
upon the earliest Shinto cult, and the later influences of Confucianism
and Buddhism in Japan have tended rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> to strengthen than to suppress
it in the popular mind.</p>

<p>These animistic conceptions have played a noteworthy part in connection
with most, if not all, the religions of mankind. When combined with a
groveling fear of the spirits, and with the practice of magic rites and
incantations to propitiate them as so many evil demons, the belief has
run into the lowest forms of superstition. But is there no element of
truth in Animism? Why should we speak disparagingly of the old Japanese
worshiper hearing the voices of unseen spirits in the moaning winds, in
the sounding waterfalls, in the rolling thunder? Why should he not adore
the Sun as the heavenly Benefactor, and see in waving trees and blooming
flowers and drifting clouds the presence and activity of beings, perhaps
sometimes a Being Supernatural? One-sided, defective puerile notions
controlled, no doubt, his thinking, but the one supreme and fundamental
fact was that he felt himself in the presence of the Supernatural. And
that primeval concept is the one most essential truth of all religion.
We have only to divest it of sundry errant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> non-essential
interpretations in order to come face to face with the grandest,
noblest, and most affecting theism, and monotheism as well. For
monotheism finds its most advanced exposition in the doctrine of the
universal immanence of God,&mdash;one God, the Eternal Spirit, in all,
through all, over all. How far from such a concept of universal Animism
was the old Hebrew psalmist, who sang of Jehovah "laying the beams of
His chambers in the waters, making the clouds His chariot, walking upon
the wings of the wind, sending forth springs into the valleys, causing
the grass to grow upon the mountains," and receiving tribute of praises
from the "sea-monsters and all deeps; fire and hail, snow and vapor;
stormy wind performing His word; mountains and all hills; fruitful trees
and all cedars; beasts and all cattle; creeping things and flying
birds." To such a worshiper the world was all alive with God. And Jesus
added an intensity and an affecting beauty to this whole concept of an
immanent God when He said: "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work," and
"not one sparrow falleth on the ground without your Father." I can
conceive no Animism and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> Supernaturalism more minute or more adorable
than the ever acting and ever continuous presence of an unseen but all
observant "Father in the heavens." The heavens in which He dwells are
above, below, within, and all around us.</p>

<p>And this is the higher Animism which ought to be welcomed by the Shinto
pilgrims of Japan as the beautiful fulfilling of their ancient dreams.
Not so many gods, not a multitude of unfriendly spirits that need
propitiation by our gifts of food and clothing, but <span class="small">ONE</span> Heavenly Father,
immanent in every plant that grows and in every dewdrop on the flowers,
forever working for our good, caring for every birdling, and numbering
the very hairs of our head.</p>

<p>With such a monotheistic conception of the world all mythologic and
polytheistic notions of deity and the rule of the spirits of the dead
must sooner or later disappear. Japanese scholars of high rank are
telling their people and others that the modern Western learning has
already destroyed the cosmogony of the Shinto cult. What is now most
needed is a class of teachers straightforward and broad enough to show
these people a nobler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> and truer concept of the world. The new
conception need have no conflict with the belief that the spirits of the
dead are all about us, and are deeply interested in us still. The family
cult may adjust itself to the new and higher doctrines, and lose none of
the beauty and tenderness and sanctity which old affection connects with
the domestic tablets of the honored and beloved dead. Herein the new
faith is to fulfill rather than destroy the ancient rites of love. Such
a monotheistic cult will find no reason or occasion to commit the
blunder of the Jesuit missionaries, and seek interference with the
government of the land. The Mikado may still command the reverence and
the love of the people and be rationally honored as a child of heaven.
Loyal Christians do that under every form of government. "Fear God;
honor the king; for there is no power but God, and the powers that be
are ordained of God; for they are the ministers of God's
service;"&mdash;these are the precepts of the earliest apostolic gospel, and
the modern missionary of Christ is bound to observe and teach them. He
should exhibit common sense and discretion in foreign politics,
recognize and honor the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> legitimate power, and like the Great Teacher,
"render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and unto God the things
that are God's."</p>

<p>The Shinto cult is essentially a religion of race and national
patriotism. It is the secret of Japanese heroism and sacrifice in the
day of battle. He counts it sweet and glorious to die for his country.
He is not his own; he belongs to the State. We are told that the three
principal commandments of the public and official Shinto faith are
these:</p>

<p>1. "Thou shalt honor the gods and love thy country.</p>

<p>2. "Thou shalt clearly understand the principles of Heaven, and the duty
of man.</p>

<p>3. "Thou shalt revere the emperor as thy sovereign, and obey the will of
his court."</p>

<p>Surely these principles and precepts are capable of easy adjustment to
any form of national government, and the ethics of Christianity are in
fundamental accord with their essential claims.</p>

<p>But how can the Christian religion, with its monotheistic worship,
adjust itself without antagonism to the ancestor worship of Japan? Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
seem to think that in this particular there must needs be an
irrepressible conflict, for the worship of ancestors is central and
fundamental in the Shinto faith, and the most precious and hallowed bond
that holds the family, the community, and the State together.</p>

<p>In this matter we do well to observe a number of relevant facts.
Ancestor worship has existed in a variety of forms among many peoples.
It has undergone various modifications in different countries, and it
appears to have ceased among some peoples and given place to other ideas
and forms of worship. The Japanese conception is that their Mikado and
all his people are offspring of the gods, and each one, when he dies,
becomes a deity, but does not cease to have interest in the relatives
and companions of his earthly life. During the siege of Port Arthur,
Togo sent the Mikado a message in which he expressed the thought that
the patriotic <i>manes</i> of the fallen heroes might hover over the
battlefield for a long time and give unseen protection to the Imperial
forces. Such a faith and such inspiration from the dead are things which
a proud nation does not easily let die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>But may we not approach the devotees of such a faith with the words of
the old Hebrew prophet: "Have we not all one father? Hath not one God
created us?" Ye think your honored ancestors still live, and love to
think of you and aid you from their higher sphere; is it not also just
as true of the ancestors and heroes of other lands and peoples? You have
learned that your beautiful "land of the reed-plains and the fresh
rice-ears" is only a very small portion of the world of men. Have these
broader lands and more numerous peoples sprung from other and greater
gods than yours? May it not rather be that, as there is only one sun to
shine on all this habitable world, so there is one Heavenly Father of us
all? Then we are all offspring of one Supreme God and we should all be
brethren. Our ancestors and dear kindred who have passed out of our
sight should lose no place in our affection by this larger thought.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>By some such suggestions, and by such friendly and persuasive appeal to
larger truths, it would seem that a higher and purer faith may commend
itself to the adherents of Shinto, without provoking their hostility,
and without the compromise of any essential Christian truth. As surely
as self-evidencing science wins her onward way among the nations, so
surely will self-evidencing truths of religion win the hearts of men. We
are familiar with the Christian congregations singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Faith of our fathers, holy faith!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will be true to thee till death."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Christian and Shintoist should note the fact that the fathers and
the sons are greater than the faith. As "the Sabbath was made for man,
and not man for the Sabbath," so the faith, the forms of worship, the
æsthetic arts, the culture, the learning, and all the ennobling elements
of the highest civilization are made for man, not man for them. Being,
therefore, not an end in themselves, but a means to the attainment of
some higher boon, they must all be judged according to the broad and
noble proverb: "Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are
honorable, whatsoever things are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> just, whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if
there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, take account of these
things" (Phil. 4:8).</p>

<p>It may be that ancestral shrines will become more sacred and more
heavenly when lighted with the glimmer of immortal hopes of blessed
reunion in the unseen world, and our forms and manner of honoring father
and mother and friends that pass out from our homes may be safely left
to adjust themselves to an uplifting faith that lives in the heart and
ever longs for all that is holiest and best.</p>

<p>The whole world looks with admiration upon that island-empire of the
Orient that has shown within thirty years such marvelous capacities of
adaptation and improvement. If she thus go on to "prove all things and
hold fast to that which is good," who knows but her brilliant rising to
great power and influence among the nations may mark the beginning of
world-wide reforms? Her tremendous, bloody battles should say to all
mankind: "Let us have no more of this. Let us establish great,
trustworthy tribunals of arbitra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>tion, and settle our rights and
differences there. Let us beat our swords into plowshares and our spears
into pruning-hooks." Such triumphs of peace and righteousness might well
bring to pass the old Shinto ideal of a code of morals so deeply written
in the hearts of men and of rulers that they spontaneously do that which
is obviously right. For is not this lofty ideal in accord with that of
the Hebrew prophet who descried a coming golden age when "they should
teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying,
Know the Lord; for they shall all know the Lord, from the least of them
unto the greatest" (Jer. 31:34)?</p>

<p>On the assumption that the highest form of religion must needs respond
to the highest moral test, the editor of <i>The Hibbert Journal</i><a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
propounds the following startling question, "How would the general
status of Christianity be affected by the appearance in the world of a
religion which should stand the test better than herself?" That is, a
religion or people that should present an exhibition of moral excellence
superior to that seen among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> Christian nations. Our own belief is
that such an exhibition of moral excellence in a non-Christian people
would set the Christian searching his own standards of morality. It may
be that Japan in her late exhibitions of ability in political diplomacy,
and her sacrifice and waiving of certain rightful claims to indemnity,
and the exalting of the right and the truth above narrow, selfish
interests, has put to shame the "Christian Powers" of Europe, whose
conspicuous qualities have been baneful statecraft, jealousy of rivals,
and greed to enlarge their territory by crushing feebler States, and
grinding down the masses of the people. Such an exhibit would not prove
the inferiority of Christian ethics, but the failure of the so-called
Christian Powers to honor and exemplify the ethics of our gospel. The
plain fact in this matter is, as thoughtful men must everywhere
acknowledge, that the aggressive "Christian Powers" have enlarged their
empire at the expense of weaker States and, by taking advantage of their
day of weakness and adversity, have by such ambitious procedures belied
and violated the fundamental commandments of the religion which they
profess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>We Americans have dreamed and sometimes boasted that our great Republic
of freedom has proven a mighty evangel of human liberty and rights. It
is a luminous star of the first magnitude, and it arose in the Western
hemisphere. But this brilliant star of the West has cast its helpful
beams across the Pacific Ocean upon the blooming rice-fields of Japan.
It may be that those grandchildren of the sun-goddess may by their skill
and prowess flash upon the world a light so strong as to eclipse to some
extent our own, and be so self-evidently excellent that all mankind will
bid it welcome. It may or may not be that all will acknowledge the
radiant Evangel as "the root and the offspring of David." With the
Japanese it may for long be insisted that this new Light is the root and
offspring of the Mikado and the Goddess of the Dawn. But we can waive
that point and all of us cry out, Let the true Light come. If it make
for righteousness and love and the peace of the world, we shall hail its
rising in the far East as the light of "the bright, the Morning Star;"
for there is no other that can ultimately prove itself to be "the true
Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world."</p>

have said: "We have for many generations sent to Europe exquisite
lacquer work, delicately carved figures, beautiful embroidery, and many
other things which show our artistic ability and accomplishments, but
the Europeans said we were uncivilized. We have recently killed some

an interesting comparison of "Persian elements in Japanese legends," in

with the Mazdean Amesha-spentas, and analogies of the underworld in

"The ethics of Shinto were all comprised in the doctrine of unqualified
obedience to customs originating, for the most part, in the family cult.
Ethics were not different from religion; religion was not different from
government, and the very word for government signified 'matters of
religion.' All government ceremonies were preceded by prayer and
sacrifice; and from the highest rank of society to the lowest every
person was subject to the law of tradition. To obey was piety; to
disobey was impious, and the rule of obedience was enforced upon each
individual by the will of the community to which he belonged."&mdash;"Japan,

not to be deemed an objectional element of true religion. Rather the
opposite idea, that religion is a matter of soul-peril and seriousness
so grave as to produce fear or dread of the deity, is a perversion of
the truth. True love of God (or of the gods) must needs have wholesome
reverence for what is adorable, but also ought to inspire a warmth of
affection and a confidence that drives out superstitious fear and begets
exquisite delight in the heart and soul and mind of the true worshiper.</p></div>

theory and multitudinous in practice. Not only are there gods of
goodness, but also gods of lust and of evil, to whom robbers and harlots
may pray for success and blessing." But in all this multitudinous
pantheon there is no one Supreme Deity. "There is no word in the
Japanese language corresponding to the English term God. The nearest
approach to it are the Confucian terms Jo-tei, 'Supreme Emperor;' Ten,
'Heaven,' and Ten-tei, 'Heavenly Emperor;' but all of these terms are
Chinese; they are therefore of late appearance in Japan, and represent
rather conceptions of educated and Confucian classes than the ideas of
the masses."&mdash;"Evolution of the Japanese," p. 311.</p></div>

be the defects of Japanese character in general, it is common for nearly
all travelers who have visited the country and studied the habits of the
people at their homes, to speak of them as mild, courteous, cleanly,
frugal, intelligent, quick to learn, and gifted with a genius for
imitation. Their soldiers have proved themselves a match for the most
renowned warriors, and are marvelously apt to make the most of
opportunities.</p></div>

from the Japan Mail (of September 30, 1899) a number of special
instructions to be given to the pupils in the Japanese schools touching
their behavior toward foreigners. One of the orders reads thus: "Since
all human beings are brothers and sisters, there is no reason for
fearing foreigners. Treat them as equals and act uprightly in all your
dealings with them." Such instruction should surely, in time, enlarge
the world-conception of the Shintoist.</p></div>
